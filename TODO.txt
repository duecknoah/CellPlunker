- Make CableUnits join or split on cell updates
- Make it so pressing 'h' hides Wireless connections
- Make Wireless connection lines a more subtle color (maybe dark gray?)
- Fix bug when u remove a switch cell that is on, it does not update the connected CableCell to turn off
- Change color of switch cell, maybe show a icon indicating whether it is on or off (without using state view)
- Only draw what u can see
